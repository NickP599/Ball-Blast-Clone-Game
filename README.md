# Ball Blast Mechanics Experiment

## Description

This is a **learning project** created to experiment with and study the mechanics of the game Ball Blast. The main goal is to practice game development skills by recreating and modifying key elements of the original game.

-**What is Ball Blast?**

Ball Blast is a popular mobile arcade game where the player controls a cannon that shoots falling balls. The balls split into smaller pieces when hit, and the player must avoid getting crushed while destroying them.

-**What is done in this project?**

In this project, I experimented with the following mechanics:

- Ball physics and splitting behavior

- Cannon shooting mechanics and projectile motion

- Collision detection and object destruction

- Scoring system and difficulty scaling

This project is not a complete game but rather an exploration of specific game mechanics.

## How to Run

- Clone this repository to your local machine:

- git clone 

- Open the project in Unity (version 6000 or later).

- Press the "Play" button in the Unity editor to run the scene.

This project was developed for educational purposes. Any contributions and improvements are welcome!
